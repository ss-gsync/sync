# Component Synchronization

The G-SYNC system implements precise synchronization between the astronomical clock, the ùúè Harmonic System Signature, and the integrated view. This synchronization is critical for security verification and system integrity.

## Synchronization Architecture

### 1. Timing Foundation

The astronomical clock serves as the temporal foundation for the entire system:

- **Data Exposure**: The clock makes critical timing data available through `window.astronomicalData`, which includes:
  - `time`: Current time value used for calculations
  - `bodies`: Planetary positions normalized to a unit circle
  - `julianCycle`: Current Julian day value for cross-component synchronization

- **Implementation**: Julian Day calculations provide a scientifically verifiable time reference that can be validated against astronomical observations.

### 2. ùúè Harmonic Integration

The Quantum Identity component receives timing data from the astronomical clock:

- **Pattern Generation**: The ùúè Harmonic pattern is implemented using a CPPN (Compositional Pattern-Producing Network) from the ash-token module
- **Temporal Translation**: The `_timestamp_to_temporal_factor` function converts Julian Day timing to a temporal factor (0 to 2œÄ) for the rotating dot
- **Animation Flow**: The `generate_token` function uses the temporal factor derived from astronomical timing to animate the pattern evolution

### 3. Rotation Synchronization

The rotation of elements across components is precisely coordinated:

- **Position Calculation**: `const positionCycle = julianDayFraction + activeComponentIntegrated` combines the Julian Day fraction with the active component cycle to create synchronized rotation
- **Global Coordination**: The integrated view rotates based on the Julian Day with `ctx.rotate(globalRotation)`
- **Pattern Evolution**: The CPPN's `generate_token_pattern` function applies temporal evolution using the golden ratio (œÜ) and temporal factor, directly affecting dot movement

### 4. Golden Ratio Mathematics

The golden ratio (œÜ = 1.618033988749895) creates mathematically significant relationships:

- **Astronomical Implementation**: The clock uses PHI to establish a golden ratio relationship between the secondary and tertiary hands
- **Temporal Mapping**: The temporal factor uses a 0-2œÄ range, corresponding to a full rotation that matches the astronomical clock's rotation principle
- **Flow Visualization**: The source angle for data flow lines is derived from the global rotation: `const sourceAngle = (a * Math.PI * 2 / 5) + globalRotation`

### 5. Data Flow Integration

The system visualizes how data flows between components:

- **Component Relationships**: The code explicitly establishes that "Astronomical Sync PRODUCES Quantum Identity"
- **Synchronized Movement**: The position cycle combines Julian Day fraction with active components for coordinated animation
- **Visual Representation**: Flow lines visualize how astronomical data influences the quantum identity through golden ratio relationships

### 6. Pulse Harmonization

Visual pulses across components are synchronized:

- **Core Formula**: `evolved_value = np.tanh(value + 0.1 * np.sin(temporal_factor * self.phi * value))` synchronizes the dot's pulse with astronomical timing using the golden ratio
- **Shared Timing**: The `julianCycle` value ensures all components share the same temporal foundation
- **Visual Effects**: Star brightness in the integrated view is calculated using Julian Day fraction, creating synchronized visual pulsing

## Technical Implementation Summary

The synchronized components maintain their coordination through:

1. Julian Day calculations from the astronomical clock serving as the temporal foundation
2. The PHI constant (golden ratio) creating mathematically significant relationships  
3. Deterministic timing functions ensuring consistent motion across all components
4. Shared state through `window.astronomicalData` and other global variables

The moving dots in both the ùúè Harmonic CPPN output and the integrated view derive their movement from the same Julian Day calculations, maintaining perfect proportional synchronization as specified in the system architecture.

## Code References

Key synchronization points in the codebase include:

```javascript
// In astronomical clock module
window.astronomicalData = {
  time: currentTime,
  bodies: planetaryPositions,
  julianCycle: julianDayValue
};

// In Quantum Identity / CPPN
function _timestamp_to_temporal_factor(timestamp) {
  // Convert Julian Day timing to 0-2œÄ range
  return (timestamp % 1) * 2 * Math.PI;
}

// In integrated view
const positionCycle = julianDayFraction + activeComponentIntegrated;
ctx.rotate(globalRotation);

// Golden ratio formula in pattern evolution
evolved_value = np.tanh(value + 0.1 * np.sin(temporal_factor * self.phi * value));

// Flow line angle calculation
const sourceAngle = (a * Math.PI * 2 / 5) + globalRotation;
```

These synchronization mechanisms ensure that all components maintain cryptographic integrity while creating a visually harmonious representation of the security system state.
